All 4 programs mse_relu.py (Task 1.a), cross_entropy_relu.py (Task 1.a), cross_entropy_tanh.py (Task 1. b), and cnn_relu.py (Task 2) must be run with python3 (it was made with and tested with Python 3.5.2 on ubuntu).

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 

usage:type into terminal: 
python3 mse_relu.py training.csv testing.csv
python3 cross_entropy_relu.py training.csv testing.csv
python3 cross_entropy_tanh.py training.csv testing.csv
python3 cnn_relu.py training.csv testing.csv

(Each of the first three programs trains 20 models and the last one trains 10 models - takes about a minute to run a program.)

the csv files that contain the data are provided in the submission folder
